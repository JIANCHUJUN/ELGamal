give me the strength lightly to bear my joys and sorrows
give me the strength to make my love fruitful in service
give me the strength never to disown the poor or bend my 
knees before insolent might
give me the strength to raise my mind high above daily trifles
and give me the strength to surrender my strength to thy will with love
